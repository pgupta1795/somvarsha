    <p className="mb-4 text-lg">What Is a Mutual Fund?</p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that mobilises funds from different
      investors to achieve a common investment objective. Funds are raised by
      selling the fund's units, which represent contributions to the mutual fund
      corpus. The fund invests this money into various assets such as stocks,
      bonds, money market instruments, real estate, gold, etc.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Fund managers professionally manage mutual funds, and invest the pooled
      money according to the scheme's objectives to make financial gains. They
      distribute returns from the mutual funds proportionately among investors
      after deducting the applicable fees also called the expense ratio.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      The most significant advantage of mutual funds is that they allow retail
      investors access to a diversified portfolio of financial securities
      (stocks, bonds, and more). This level of diversification would be
      challenging for most investors as they would need a substantial amount of
      capital. Other benefits include their professional money management and
      strict regulation by SEBI.
